# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
 C - More malloc, free is a project on the ALX Low Level Programming curriculum that teaches you how to use the malloc and free functions in C to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.

The malloc function allocates a block of memory of a specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of that block. The free function deallocates a block of memory that was previously allocated by malloc.

This project includes the following tasks:

Allocate a block of memory and print its address.
Allocate a block of memory and store a value in it.
Free a block of memory.
Allocate an array of integers and print its elements.
Free an array of integers.
To complete this project, you will need to understand the following concepts:

Dynamic memory allocation
The malloc and free functions
Pointers
