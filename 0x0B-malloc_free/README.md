This repository contains the solutions for the tasks of the 0x0B. C - malloc, free project at ALX School. The project focuses on learning dynamic memory allocation in C using malloc and free functions.

Each task is implemented in a separate C file and has its own folder containing the source code and a header file if necessary.
